### Demo NHS App
This is an experimental design prototype for the NHS app
It's goal is to explore the possibilities of what full native app cababilities can provide
This is also to help establish a prototype which we can test with end users in order to make the app more accessible
It can also serve as a tool to share ideas with stakeholders
